On the basis of the development of electronic health records (EHRs), data analytics in health
care is deemed as an essential process for accelerating the progress of clinical research (Hersh,
2007; Jensen, Jensen & Brunak, 2012; Miotto & Weng, 2015). Enriched EHRs contain crucial
information related to disease progression, and this information can help with decision
making in the health care field including for treatment selection and disease diagnosis
(Jensen, Jensen & Brunak, 2012; Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2014). However, processing
and analyzing EHR data are usually challenging because of their heterogeneity and sparsity.

# Summarize the state of the science of patient-facing information visualizations of personal health data. Specifically, we aimed to investigate 

(1) the types and components of patient-facing visualizations, and 

(2) methods and findings related to the development and evaluation of patient-facing visualizations currently reported in the literature


2018 survey :

#### type of graph msotly used
line graphs (35%), followed by number lines (25%), bar graphs (16%), and icons (12%). Line graphs were the most common types of 
visualizations employed when longitudinal data were displayed. Other visualizations were used in three or fewer articles, and included body maps, scatterplots, radar graphs, and visual paragraphs.



#### colour and numbers
The most common visualization component overall was numbers, included in 88% of visualizations, and in all types of visualizations 
we reviewed except body maps. Color was also frequently included (77%) and was found in all types of visualizations we reviewed except
visual paragraphs and radar graphs. The “traffic light” color scheme (red–yellow–green) was most frequently employed among the visualizations
that included color. Data labels (which specify units and other details about the data within the visualization), longitudinal data displays, 
contextual information, such as descriptive text (“your blood pressure improved”) and references ranges were included in nearly half of visualizations (40–47%).

Given that this condition affects an estimated 8% of the male population, 66 color-blindness screening should also be included in future research
In addition, colors and symbols take on different meanings depending on the patient's cultural background 19 67 which highlights the importance of investigating how
the target patient population interprets color when evaluating visualizations which use color encodings

### Analytic

The visualizations that did feature data analytics included algorithms that calculated risk scores and identified significant trends or patterns in the data.


## there are no consistent approaches in the literature for selecting, developing, or evaluating visualizations according to a particular data type or goal


uances in visualization types and components varied widely between articles, as did the methods and measures used to evaluate them. For example, some articles
reported general qualitative preferences while some conducted quantitative comprehension and risk perception testing using randomization methods. 

Moreover,
in several articles, the purposes of the visualizations were not explicitly stated. The range of possible purposes is wide, 
#### from interpreting a single value,
#### to interpreting values in the context of a goal value or range, 
#### to identifying important trends over time.


### SDOH visualziation is challenging :

Finally, there exist synergistic opportunities to enhance interpretation and guide behaviors by leveraging data scienc
e and using clinically meaningful boundaries, otherwise known as minimally important differences (MIDs). 68 Less than one quarter
of the visualizations in the reviewed articles used advanced analytics to generate deeper insights in the data, such as
risk scores and significant trends. There have been countless advancements in health data science such that algorithms can now 
identify meaningful patterns and generate predictions from personal health data. 

As such, there exists a major opportunity to pair advanced analytics with visualization to convey clinically meaningful and actionable information to patients.
 The prevalence of visualizations displaying laboratory values among articles in this review is aligned with a recent report showing that laboratory test results
 are the most common type of information currently offered in patient portals.  Nonetheless, MIDs for many other types of personal health data (symptoms and health behaviors)
 are equally important but more challenging to identify and convey to patients.
